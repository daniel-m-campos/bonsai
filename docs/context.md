# Project Context — GBT Library

> **Purpose of this doc**: Single-source briefing for any agent (or future-you) picking up this project. Captures decisions made, rationale, what's deferred, and what's out of scope. Keep this updated as decisions evolve; it's the first thing any new session should read.

## 1. Project in two sentences

A from-scratch C++23 implementation of a histogram-based gradient boosted trees library. Goal is to demonstrate modern C++ techniques (concepts, parameter packs, fold expressions, optional reflection) and parallelism (OpenMP + std::execution) while producing a working, benchmarked GBT that can be compared against xgboost / lightgbm / catboost on one regression dataset for the MVP.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

**Goals:**
- Working serial histogram-GBT with regression as the live MVP path (parity, golden, benchmarks all run against one regression dataset).
- Logloss objective + binary-classification prediction path implemented alongside MSE in MVP, but only as far as unit tests + synthetic-data smoke tests carry it. Live classification parity is Phase 4. The goal is to keep the `Objective` concept and dispatch honest under a second implementation, not to debug two reference datasets at once.
- Parity (within tolerance) with reference libraries on RMSE on the MVP regression dataset. AUC parity on a classification dataset is added in Phase 4.
- Two parallel backends (OpenMP, std::execution) with measurable speedup.
- Clean extension API spanning the conceptual surface of all three reference libraries (different growers, splitters, samplers).
- Modern C++ showcase: concepts, static dispatch in hot paths, optional C++26 reflection branch.
- CLI-first (no Python bindings), CatBoost-style argument conventions.

**Non-goals:**
- Beating xgboost/lgbm on training speed (they have years of tuning).
- Production readiness, ABI stability, or distribution.
- Python/R bindings.
- GPU support.
- DART, Random Forest, or ranking objectives in the main path.
- Distributed training.
- Multiclass classification in the main path.
- Full classification parity / golden / benchmark coverage in the MVP. Logloss code lives in MVP under unit tests, but a second live reference dataset is not debugged in parallel with regression.
- Categorical features in MVP (deferred to Phase 4 as extension demo).

## 3. Justification beyond pedagogy

The honest pitch (use these in proposal section 1):
- **Reference value**: Production GBT libraries are large and hard to read. A clean ~3-5K LOC version with thorough docs is a teaching artifact.
- **Architectural improvement**: Compile-time dispatch in the inner loop is a measurable refinement over the uniform-virtual approach in xgb/lgbm. Microbenchmark with/without virtualization is a real result.
- **Maintainability via concepts**: Component contract violations caught at compile time, not runtime — improvement over reference libraries.

Avoid claiming: speed parity with reference libraries, production suitability.

## 3.5. Spine implementation status

The spine is the end-to-end core path. Status as of 2026-05-18 (CLI, CSV reader, TOML loader, model save/load, Python comparison sidecar, and the typed-section config / metric registry / fit-time metric tick logging features are landed):

| Spine component | Status | File(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `Dataset`, `BinMapper`, `BinMappers` | done | `include/bonsai/{dataset,bin_mapper,bin_mappers}.hpp` |
| `Histogram` | done | `include/bonsai/histogram.hpp` |
| Depth-wise `TreeGrower`, `Tree` | done | `include/bonsai/{grower,tree}.hpp` |
| Histogram `SplitFinder` | done | `include/bonsai/split.hpp` |
| `Objective` concept + MSE + LogLoss | done | `include/bonsai/objective.hpp` |
| `Sampler` concept | done | `include/bonsai/sampler.hpp` |
| `Booster<O,G,Sp,Sa>` + `IBooster` | done | `include/bonsai/booster.hpp` |
| Registry / dispatch (flat table) | done | `include/bonsai/registry/`, `include/bonsai/typelist.hpp` |
| Dispatch resolution doc | done | `docs/architecture/6-dispatch.md` |
| `ParallelBackend` concept | Phase 3 | (doc 7 TBD) |
| `SerialBackend`, `OpenMPBackend` | Phase 3 | (depends on doc 7) |

**Spine complete as of 2026-05-18.** Everything required to ship the Phase 1 MVP and Phase 2 benchmark harness is in place. The two remaining rows (`ParallelBackend` concept + first impl) are Phase 3 work.

## 4. Decisions made (with rationale)

### Architecture
- **Static polymorphism in hot paths, dynamic at config boundary.** Components (Objective, TreeGrower, SplitFinder, Sampler) are concepts. `Booster<Obj, Gr, Sp, Sa>` is a class template. Runtime dispatch from TOML string happens once at construction; everything inside the booster is statically dispatched. Cost: cartesian product instantiations (~15-90 variants), acceptable at this scale. Resolved as a flat table over `cartesian_product_t<...>` (decision 26); see `architecture/6-dispatch.md`.

- **`Booster` as single concrete class for now**, not abstract base. Virtualize when adding DART/RF (probably never, given non-goals).

- **Typelist registry for runtime → type dispatch** at the config boundary. Each impl declares `static constexpr std::string_view name`. Registry is `Registry<Base, Config, Impls...>` with fold-expression dispatch. No macros, no static-init, no linker-stripping issues. Concepts enforce contract at compile time.

- **No registry aliases.** Single canonical name per component. xgb/lgbm have many aliases per concept; not worth the maintenance.

- **Optional reflection branch** for the registry, using gcc-trunk (P2996 / static reflection in C++26). User has this working in another project. Showcase only; typelist version is the production path.

- **Skip the abstract-factory profile pattern.** Earlier sketch proposed using an abstract_factory for "lgbm-style profile" bundles. Rejected as abstraction-for-its-own-sake; TOML defaults handle presets fine.

### Data layout (lock in early, expensive to change)
- **Column-major storage.** Histograms read one feature across all rows; row-major destroys cache. Non-negotiable.
- **Per-feature uint8 vs uint16 bins** depending on `max_bin`. Saves 50% memory for the common case (max_bin <= 255). `std::variant` per feature column.
- **`std::span` returns** from Dataset, not vector copies.
- **Float storage, double accumulators.** Float for labels, scores, gradients in storage. Double for histogram accumulation, split scoring. Matches xgb/lgbm. Half the bandwidth, no measurable accuracy loss.

### Iteration model
- **`Booster::update_one_iter()`** as the unit of progress. Top-level `train()` is a loop over this. Callbacks (logging, snapshotting, early stopping) live outside the core. Mirrors xgb/lgbm.

### Parallelism
- **Two backends, both implemented**: OpenMP (primary, standard for this domain) and std::execution (showcase). Selected by CLI flag. Same benchmarks run against both.
- **Known risk**: libstdc++ `std::execution::par` requires linking TBB or it falls back silently to serial. Vendor TBB via FetchContent. Add a runtime check.
- **Determinism is a hard requirement at fixed thread count.** Same seed
  + same `n_threads` → same model bytes. Cross-thread-count: predictions within tolerance, bytes may differ. Forces per-thread local hists from day one (no atomic FP adds — bit-unstable even at fixed N). See decisions §7.

### Testing
- **Catch2 v3** (link `Catch2WithMain`).
- **Layered**: unit / integration / numerical-parity / benchmarks.
- **Tolerance-based** comparisons via `WithinAbs` (parallel reductions are non-associative for floats).
- **Property-based tests** for bin mapper using Catch2 `GENERATE`.
- **Determinism test** from the start (will fail first time you parallelize if you didn't design for it — that's the point).
- **Golden-file tests** for 1-2 small datasets (commit reference predictions, fail on drift).

### CLI
- **CatBoost-style subcommands**: `bonsai fit`, `bonsai predict`, `bonsai eval`, `bonsai bench`, `bonsai info`, `bonsai params`.
- **CLI11** for parsing — header-only, dotted/nested keys, no deps.
- **Fit-time output** is text via `std::print` from a tick callback gated on `booster.log_intervals`. Streaming progress-bar UI is deferred (not currently wired).
- **TOML config + CLI overrides** via dotted `--set` keys (`--set tree.max_depth=8`, repeatable). Resolution: defaults → file → CLI. Last write wins.
- **toml++** for parsing (strict mode — reject unknown keys).

### Config schema
- **Sections = component instances.** `[objective]`, `[tree]`, `[sampler]`, `[split]` each map to one factory call. `name` field selects impl, rest is impl-specific config.
- **Strongly-typed nested structs** in C++. Defaults at struct level, not in parser.
- **Component-specific params live with the component** (`top_rate` is in `[sampler]`, not global).
- **Validation in component constructors**, not centralized. Throw `ConfigError` with key path on bad input.
- **No `extra` map for "future-proofing."** Strict typing throughout.

### Logging
- **spdlog** is fetched but not yet wired into source. CLI fit-time output is `std::print` for now (decision deferred until a real logging surface needs structured records).

### Build
- **CMake with FetchContent** for all deps (Catch2, CLI11, toml++, spdlog, nlohmann/json). google-benchmark and TBB will be added when the microbench and parallel backends land.
- **OBJECT libraries** for component groups — avoids static-archive dead-code stripping issues.
- **No system package dependencies** — a single `cmake --build` builds everything from a clean checkout.

## 5. Decisions deferred / open questions

- **Numerical parity tolerance values** — pick after seeing actual variance.
- **Whether to implement the C++26 reflection branch** or just sketch it. Depends on time remaining after main path is solid.
- **Snapshot/checkpoint format** — defer until needed; simple binary dump for v1.
- **CV runner** — nice-to-have, defer.

## 6. Architecture sketch

Current layout: `include/bonsai/` is mostly flat with header-per-component; subdirectories exist for `cli/`, `config/`, `io/`, `registry/`, and `detail/`. Source mirrors `src/`. Aspirational shape, mapping component to file or directory (future impls noted where they don't exist yet):

```
include/bonsai/
  dataset.hpp, bin_mapper.hpp, bin_mappers.hpp, histogram.hpp
                — Dataset, BinMapper, Histogram, Gradient
  tree.hpp, grower.hpp
                — Tree, Node, TreeGrower concept;
                  impls: depthwise (now); leafwise, oblivious (future)

                — Objective concept; impls: mse, logloss (now);
                  softmax, quantile, huber (future)
  sampler.hpp   — Sampler concept; impls: all_rows (now);

                  impls: serial, openmp, stdexec
  booster.hpp   — Booster<Obj, Gr, Sa>, IBooster, training loop
  io/           — CSV reader; model save/load (MessagePack);
                  libsvm, parquet readers (future)
  config/       — Config struct, typed sections, FieldCodec,
                  TOML parser + dumper, CLI override merger
  registry/     — flat table over cartesian_product_t<...>,
                  IBooster at boundary
  cli/          — subcommand handlers
                  (fit, predict, eval, bench, info, params)
```

## 7. Implementation phases (high level)

1. **Phase 1: Serial MVP.** Numeric features only. MSE is the live parity target on one regression dataset (California Housing). Logloss objective ships alongside MSE — analytical-gradient unit tests + a synthetic 2-class smoke test, no live reference dataset. Depth-wise grower, histogram splitter, all-rows sampler. CLI: fit / predict / eval / bench / info / params. TOML config + CLI overrides.
2. **Phase 2: Benchmark harness.** California Housing parity script vs xgboost / lightgbm / catboost (RMSE), golden files, microbenchmark scaffold.

**Phase 2.5: CLI design + cleanup** (inserted 2026-05-18, decision 28). Before turning on parallelism, take a pass on CLI usability, the typed-config surface, and the small things glossed over during the Phase 1/2 sprints. Items captured as concrete tasks during the work, not pre-listed here. No new spine, no parallel backends; refactors are fair game now that AI assistance is open.

3. **Phase 3: Parallelism.** OpenMP first (feature-parallel hist construction, row-parallel within feature, parallel predict, SIMD bin scan). Then std::execution variant. Determinism + tolerance regression throughout. Adds YearPredictionMSD as the perf benchmark (California Housing is too small to expose scaling); speedup curves are measured here, not on the integration dataset.
4. **Phase 4: Extensions.** First item is binary classification parity: wire in a classification reference dataset (Higgs subset), AUC parity tests, golden file. Logloss code is already in the codebase from Phase 1, so this is dataset wiring + tuning, not new core code. Then leaf-wise grower, oblivious grower, GOSS sampler, exact splitter, categorical handlers — one per "library style" demonstrates the extension API claim.
5. **Stretch:** C++26 reflection branch for registry, Python via pybind11 (probably skip), monotonic constraints.

Phases are ordered, not time-boxed. No week assignments.

`README.md` stays short — points readers at `docs/proposal.md`.

`docs/proposal.md` sections (locked):
1. Application idea + justification beyond pedagogy
2. Survey of xgboost / lgbm / catboost (table)
3. Core architecture (entities, extension points, perf-sensitive, data invariants, metaprogramming approach, static vs dynamic polymorphism, dispatch boundary)
4. Testing approach
5. Benchmarking approach
6. External dependencies
7. Implementation phases (table)
8. Physical design / directory structure
+ Goals/non-goals near top
+ Open questions / risks before phase plan
+ Evaluation criteria for final report (figures/tables planned)

`architecture/` holds per-component design docs. Each numbered file covers one component (Dataset, Histogram, Tree, etc.) in enough depth to implement it. `architecture/README.md` is the index plus cross-cutting concerns (dispatch architecture, threading model, error handling, determinism contract).

`decisions.md` is the append-only decisions log. Plain ordered list, caveman style, one entry per non-trivial choice. New entries at the bottom; numbering never reused.

## 9. Tech stack (locked)

| Concern | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | C++23 | gcc-trunk for optional reflection branch (C++26) |
| Build | CMake + FetchContent | No system deps |
| CLI | CLI11 | Dotted nested keys |
| Config | toml++ | Strict mode, reject unknown keys |
| Progress | `std::print` tick callback | indicators (p-ranav) deferred |
| Logging | spdlog (fetched, not yet wired) | structured logging deferred |
| Tests | Catch2 v3 | Link `Catch2WithMain` |
| Bench | google-benchmark (planned) | not yet fetched |
| Parallel (planned) | OpenMP + std::execution | TBB to be vendored for stdexec |

## 10. Evaluation criteria (figures planned for final report)

- **Predictive parity table**: RMSE on the MVP regression dataset (and AUC once the Phase 4 classification dataset lands) vs xgb/lgbm/catboost at matched hyperparameters
- **Speedup curves**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads; OpenMP vs std::execution
- **Static vs dynamic dispatch microbenchmark**: hot path with/without virtualization
- **Ablation studies**: histogram subtraction on/off, GOSS on/off, bin width (255 vs 65535)
- **Memory footprint**: peak RSS during training, model size on disk

These figures should drive instrumentation decisions in the code.

## 11. What this doc is not

- Not the proposal. The proposal pitches the design; this is the working briefing.
- Not a replacement for `architecture/`. This is the briefing; those are the per-component deep dives.
- Not append-only. Update in place as decisions evolve. Use `decisions.md` for the audit trail of *changes*.
